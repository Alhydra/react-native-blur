My name is Youssef el habchi, from [React Native Master](https://rn-master.com) I have recently wrote an article exploring how to render a React Native Blur, And this repository contains the code I have used, feel free to use it in your project and share it with your peers, if you feel like reading the article, which I recommend follow this link [Applying Blur Effect In React Native](https://rn-master.com/applying-blur-effect-in-react-native/)
If you would like to try the app on Expo, I have prepared an [Expo.io Project](https://expo.io/@alhydra/react-native-blur-example)
